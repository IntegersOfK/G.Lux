G.Lux
=====

Chrome Extension that changes the color temperature of the browser tab. An f.lux alternative for ChromeOS and Chrome Browser users.

Available for download on the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glux/hinolicfmhnjadpggledmhnffommefaf?hl=en

G.lux is a free and unofficial variation of F.lux, a desktop app that automatically changes the color temperature of your monitor as the sun goes down. Monitors are typically daylight balanced, which can interfere with your sleep cycle when using them after sunset. G.lux is an alternative for those who are unable to install F.lux due to their operating system or administrator access settings, such as schools and workplaces. In addition, G.lux is currently the only F.lux alternative for millions of ChromeOS users worldwide.

Why would I want to change the color temperature of my webpages?
Modern displays are 'daylight balanced' causing your brain to think it's daytime, which can keep you from falling asleep at night. In the evening, our eyes naturally expect a more orangish 'tungsten balance.' G.lux is also a useful companion for multitasking photo editors, movie watchers and anyone looking to dim solely their browser without the rest of their desktop applications.

June 18, 2014 version 3.0 Changelog:
-New in 3.0! (Most popular user suggestion) Select a time of day to activate automatically! Set the activation time to your local sunset for an optimal circadian rhythm!

-New in 3.0! Dropdown color list has been changed to a much better box-like interface.

Features:
-Change the color temperature of your browser/websites.

-Make your websites darker without using the monitor or operating system display settings.

-Choose a custom color for your webpages. You can even make your screen pink or green!

-Variable filter intensity: One-extension for all screens and brightnesses!

-Color and intensity settings are saved across multiple Chrome browsers or ChromeOS devices.

Tips:
-Use G.lux with the black setting and a low filter intensity to create a dimmed screen between the 'screen off' position and the lowest brightness settings on your monitor. Sometimes the lowest setting just isn't dim enough!

-Select a dark theme for Chrome. This extension only changes the color temperature of the page(s) you’re viewing and not the omnibar/tabs at the top of the browser. Alternatively, you may wish to use Chrome in Full-screen mode (F11).

Other changes in 3.0:
-Custom color selection is now tolerable.
-Rebranded to American spelling of the word ‘color’ because of programming, SEO and marketing convention.
-Welcome Jessica Morin to the G.lux team.

Notes and known issues:
-The color change only comes into effect when the page has been refreshed. This is because the extension is a 'filter' being put on top of a website, and the whole page has to load before it can be injected. There does not appear to be a solution to this behavior in Chrome at this time, so a refresh of the website is required. We will continue looking at making the color change without a refresh for a future release.

Permissions:
-Access to all websites is required, because the Chrome Extension needs to be able to modify each website to inject a filter over top of what you're viewing. This Chrome extension does not collect personal information or browsing history in any way. As an open source piece of software, the community is welcome to inspect the source of chrome extensions for malicious intent.
